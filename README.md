### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm BlackWhale and this is my Github.

I love coding web apps using React but I'm also glad to dive into the backend or an API with NodeJS.
More recently I've worked in a great deal of blockchain projects, so smart-contracts or dapps would be my specialization.
Programming is more of a passion than a job for me so I work hard and make things happen.

My goal in a project is always to have a LEAN approach while keeping things tidy, performant and scalable.
Freelancer at heart but always glad to build things as a team since I enjoy the company of fellow humans.

I speak ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English and ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish.

You can contact me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vblackwhale)
